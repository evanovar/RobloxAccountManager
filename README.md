```python
from roblox_account_manager import RobloxAccountManager

manager = RobloxAccountManager()

# Get a saved cookie
cookie = manager.get_account_cookie("username")

# Validate an account
is_valid = manager.validate_account("username")

# Add account programmatically
success = manager.add_account()
```

```json
{
  "username": {
    "username": "actual_username",
    "cookie": "roblosecurity_cookie_value",
    "added_date": "2025-01-15 14:30:22"
  }
}

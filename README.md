## üîê Encryption & Security

There are 3 Encryption methods:

**1. Hardware Encryption (Hardware-Based)**
- ‚úÖ Automatic encryption using your computer's unique hardware ID
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data ONLY works on THIS computer**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hardware changes may make data unrecoverable**
  
**2. Password Encryption (Reccomended, Portable)**
- ‚úÖ Encrypt with a password you create
- ‚úÖ **Can backup to cloud** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST remember your password** - there is NO recovery method!

**3. No Encryption (Not Reccomended)**
- ‚úÖ Store accounts without any encryption
- ‚úÖ Easy to transfer and backup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT SECURE** - Anyone with access to files can see your data

## üìö Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**  
A: Yes, the tool runs entirely locally on your computer. No data is sent to external servers. However, you're responsible for following Roblox's Terms of Service.

**Q: Do I need Python installed to use the EXE version?**  
A: No! The standalone EXE includes everything you need. Just download and run.

**Q: Can I use this on Mac or Linux?**  
A: Currently, this tool is optimized for Windows only. Some features (like asterisk password input) use Windows-specific modules (`msvcrt`).

**Q: What's the difference between Console and UI mode?**  
A: 
- **Console Mode**: Fast, text-based interface. Uses less resources, ideal for automation.
- **UI Mode**: Graphical interface with extra features like game list, real-time game names, visual account management, and persistent settings.

**Q: Can I switch between Console and UI mode?**  
A: Yes! Just delete `AccountManagerData/version_config.json` and restart the program. You'll be asked to choose again.

**Q: What is the Game List feature?**  
A: UI mode automatically saves your recently launched games (with Place IDs and Private Server codes). You can configure how many games to remember (5-50) in the Settings window. Click any game in the list to quickly load it again.

**Q: What does [P] mean in the game list?**  
A: [P] indicates that the game was saved with a private server link code. Clicking it will load both the Place ID and Private Server ID.

**Q: What is Multi Roblox?**  
A: Multi Roblox allows you to run multiple Roblox instances simultaneously on the same machine. Enable it in Settings, and you can launch multiple games at once. The tool automatically handles the technical requirements (mutex and file locking).

**Q: How do I import accounts using cookies?**  
A: Open Settings window and click "Import Cookie". Paste your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie from Chrome/browser, and the tool will automatically fetch the username and add the account. The cookie is encrypted and stored securely.

**Q: Where are my data files stored?**  
A: All configuration and account data are stored in the `AccountManagerData` folder in the same directory as the program. This includes:
- `saved_accounts.json` - Your encrypted account data
- `encryption_config.json` - Encryption settings
- `ui_settings.json` - UI preferences and game list
- `version_config.json` - Console/UI mode preference

### Encryption Questions

**Q: I forgot my password! How do I recover my accounts?**  
A: Unfortunately, there is **NO password recovery method**. This is by design for security. Lost password = permanent data loss. Always remember your password or use hardware-based encryption instead.

**Q: Can I change from hardware encryption to password encryption?**  
A: Currently, there is no safe method. I will add this soon probably

**Q: Which encryption method should I choose?**  
A:
- **Choose Hardware Encryption if**: You only use one computer, want zero hassle, don't need cloud backups
- **Choose Password Encryption if**: You use multiple computers, want cloud backups, need portability

**Q: I changed my computer hardware and now can't access my accounts. What do I do?**  
A: Hardware-based encryption is permanently tied to your original hardware configuration. If you changed CPU/motherboard/UUID, the data is unrecoverable. This is why we recommend password encryption for long-term use.

**Q: Can I access my password-encrypted accounts on another computer?**  
A: Yes! Simply copy the entire `AccountManagerData` folder to the new computer, install the app, and enter your password. This folder contains `saved_accounts.json` and `encryption_config.json`.

### Account Management Questions

**Q: How many accounts can I save?**  
A: There's no hard limit. You can save as many accounts as you need.

**Q: Do saved accounts expire?**  
A: Roblox cookies can expire after long periods of inactivity or if you change your password on Roblox's website. Use the "Validate account" feature to check if an account is still valid.

**Q: Can I transfer accounts between different instances of the tool?**  
A: 
- **Hardware encryption**: No, tied to one machine only
- **Password encryption**: Yes, copy the entire `AccountManagerData` folder, then use same password

**Q: What happens if I change my Roblox password?**  
A: Your saved cookie will become invalid. You'll need to delete the old account from the manager and re-add it with the new login.

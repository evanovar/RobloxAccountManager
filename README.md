## ‚ú® Features

- **üéÆ Game Launching** - Direct game launching with specific Game IDs
- **‚úÖ Account Validation** - Check account status and validity
- **üñ•Ô∏è Simple Console Interface** - Clean, easy-to-use command-line interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Method 1: Direct EXE (Recommended for Users)

**Quick & Easy - No Python Required!**

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/evanovar/RobloxAccountManagerConsole/releases)
2. Download `RobloxAccountManager.exe` from the latest release
3. Put it in a folder (optional)
4. Double-click to run - that's it!

**Requirements:**
- **Google Chrome browser**
- **Windows** (currently optimized for Windows)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender may flag the EXE as untrusted since it's not signed. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway" to proceed.

### Method 2: Clone Repository (For Developers, or for people that don't trust the EXE)

**Full source code access and customization**
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Google Chrome browser**
- **Windows** (currently optimized for Windows)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evanovar/RobloxAccountManagerConsole
   cd RobloxAccountManagerConsole
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python roblox_account_manager.py
   ```
   
## üìã Requirements

The following Python packages are required:
- `selenium` - Browser automation
- `requests` - HTTP requests for account validation  
- `webdriver-manager` - Automatic ChromeDriver management
- `pycryptodome` - Encryption and cookie handling
- `pywin32` - Windows-specific functionality

## üîê Encryption & Security

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, you'll be prompted to choose an encryption method to protect your account data:

**1. Default Encryption (Hardware-Based)** ‚úÖ Available Now
- ‚úÖ Automatic encryption using your computer's unique hardware ID
- ‚úÖ No passwords to remember
- ‚úÖ Zero user interaction needed after setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data ONLY works on THIS computer**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cannot transfer to another machine or backup to cloud**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hardware changes may make data unrecoverable**

**2. Password Encryption** üöß Coming Soon
- Under development
- Will support cloud backup and multi-device sync

### How It Works

1. **First Launch**: Choose encryption method (currently only Hardware-Based available)
2. **Automatic Protection**: All account data in `saved_accounts.json` is encrypted
3. **Transparent Usage**: Encryption/decryption happens automatically in the background
4. **Status Display**: Main menu shows `üîí [Hardware Encrypted]` when active

## üéØ Usage

### How It Works

1. **Add Account**: Select "Add new account" from the menu
2. **Browser Opens**: A clean Chrome browser window opens to Roblox login page
3. **Login**: Log into your Roblox account normally
4. **‚ö° Login Detection**: Tool detects successful login
5. **üöÄ Auto-Close**: Browser closes immediately after detection
6. **üíæ Saved**: Username and authentication cookie are saved locally

### Menu Options

- **1. Add new account** - Ultra-fast browser automation for account addition
- **2. List saved accounts** - View all saved accounts with registration dates  
- **3. Delete account** - Remove accounts from the manager
- **4. Validate account** - Check if saved account cookies are still valid
- **5. Launch Roblox game** - Launch specific games or Roblox directly
- **6. Exit** - Close the application

### Adding an Account

1. Select option 1 from the main menu
2. Chrome browser opens automatically with optimized performance
3. Log into your Roblox account normally
4. Browser automatically closes in **25ms** after login detection
5. Account saved with username and authentication cookie

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Won't Open
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed
- Check that ChromeDriver is compatible with your Chrome version
- Restart the application (ChromeDriver auto-updates)

### Login Not Detected
- Make sure you complete the full login process
- Wait for the page to fully load after login
- The detection timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds)

### Import Errors
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or newer

### Encryption/Decryption Issues
- If you get "Decryption failed" error, your data may have been encrypted on a different computer
- Hardware-based encryption is tied to your specific machine
- Reinstalling Windows or changing hardware (CPU, motherboard) will break decryption
- **There is no recovery method** - always backup your unencrypted data before major system changes

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access

You can use the `RobloxAccountManager` class in your own scripts:

```python
from roblox_account_manager import RobloxAccountManager

manager = RobloxAccountManager()

# Get a saved cookie
cookie = manager.get_account_cookie("username")

# Validate an account
is_valid = manager.validate_account("username")

# Add account programmatically
success = manager.add_account()
```

### Cookie Format

**Unencrypted** (if encryption is disabled):
```json
{
  "username": {
    "username": "actual_username",
    "cookie": "roblosecurity_cookie_value",
    "added_date": "2025-01-15 14:30:22"
  }
}
```

**Encrypted** (with hardware-based encryption):
```json
{
  "encrypted": true,
  "data": {
    "nonce": "nonce",
    "tag": "tag",
    "ciphertext": "encrypted_data"
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **Always use encryption** - Choose hardware-based encryption on first launch
- ‚úÖ **Keep your system secure** - Use Windows Defender and keep it updated
- ‚úÖ **Don't share the EXE or files** - Your encrypted data is tied to your machine
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backup before hardware changes** - Export accounts before upgrading PC
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share `saved_accounts.json`** - Even encrypted, it's tied to your hardware
- ‚ùå **Don't use on shared computers** - Each user should have their own installation
